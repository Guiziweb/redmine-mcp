# MCP Redmine Server

An MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that integrates Redmine with AI assistants like Claude Desktop, enabling natural language interaction with your Redmine instance.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Installation

**Via Composer (Recommended):**
```bash
composer create-project guiziweb/mcp-redmine --stability=dev
```

**Via Git (For Development):**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/guiziweb/mcp-redmine.git
cd mcp-redmine
composer install
```

### 2. Configuration

> üí° **Get your Redmine API key**: Go to Redmine ‚Üí My account ‚Üí API access key ‚Üí Show

**Update `.env` file:**
```bash
REDMINE_URL=https://your-redmine-instance.com
REDMINE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

**Start the HTTP server:**
```bash
symfony server:start
# or
php -S 127.0.0.1:8000 -t public
```

**Configure MCP Client:**

Create a `.mcp.json` file:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "redmine": {
      "url": "http://127.0.0.1:8000/mcp",
      "transport": "http"
    }
  }
}
```

### 3. Restart Your AI Assistant

Close and restart your MCP client (Claude Desktop, Cursor, etc.).

## üîê Remote Access with OAuth2 (Team Sharing)

Want to share your MCP server with your team? Secure it with OAuth2 + Keycloak!

**Benefits:**
- üåê **Remote access**: Deploy once, use from anywhere
- üë• **Team sharing**: Multiple users, centralized authentication
- üîí **Access control**: Restrict by email domain, groups, roles
- üìä **Audit trail**: Track who does what

**Quick Setup:**
1. Start Keycloak with Docker
2. Configure realm with Dynamic Client Registration (DCR)
3. Update MCP server `.env` with Keycloak credentials
4. Clients auto-register and authenticate via browser

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Connection refused" or "Server not accessible"**
   - Verify HTTP server is running (`symfony server:start` or `php -S 127.0.0.1:8000`)
   - Check the URL in `.mcp.json` matches your server address
   - Ensure no firewall blocking the port

2. **"Authentication failed"**
   - Verify `REDMINE_URL` and `REDMINE_API_KEY` in `.env`
   - Check API key permissions in Redmine
   - Ensure API is enabled in Redmine settings

3. **"Invalid token" (with OAuth2)**
   - Verify Keycloak is running
   - Check OAuth config in `.env` (KEYCLOAK_URL, KEYCLOAK_REALM, KEYCLOAK_AUDIENCE)
   - Reconnect the MCP client to get a fresh token
   - See [OAuth2 Setup Guide](OAUTH_SETUP.md) for details
